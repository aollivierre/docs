The confusion between when to split arguments into an array versus passing them as a single string stems from how different tools (like `Start-Process`, `cmd.exe`, or `PsExec`) handle argument parsing.

Let's clarify **when to split arguments** into an array and **when to keep them as a single string**:

### **1. Splitting Arguments into an Array (PowerShell and Standard Tools)**

You generally want to split arguments into an array when using **PowerShell-native tools** or commands that expect individual arguments to be passed separately. This ensures that each argument is treated correctly, especially when arguments contain spaces or special characters.

#### When to use argument arrays:

-   **PowerShell Cmdlets (`Start-Process`, `Invoke-Command`, etc.)**:
    
    -   PowerShell cmdlets expect arguments to be passed individually. If you pass them as a single string, it could cause parsing issues, especially with spaces.
    -   **Example**: `Start-Process`, `New-Process`, `Invoke-Command`.
-   **Standard Executables that follow standard argument parsing**:
    
    -   Tools like `msiexec.exe`, `git.exe`, and other command-line utilities that follow the standard convention of treating space-separated values as arguments will benefit from splitting arguments.
    -   **Example**: Running `Start-Process` on `git.exe` or `msiexec.exe`.

#### Example:

powershell

Copy code

`$argList = @(
    "-NoExit"
    "-ExecutionPolicy"
    "Bypass"
    "-File"
    $scriptPath
)

Start-Process -FilePath "pwsh.exe" -ArgumentList $argList -Wait` 

**Why**: Here, each argument (like `-NoExit`, `-ExecutionPolicy`) is passed individually, ensuring PowerShell interprets them correctly.

### **2. Keeping Arguments as a Single String (Legacy Tools or PsExec)**

Some tools (like `cmd.exe`, `PsExec`, or older utilities) expect the **entire command** to be passed as a single string, especially when those tools act as a shell or intermediary for other processes. These tools don’t parse arguments the same way PowerShell does and may treat array-based arguments incorrectly.

#### When to use a single string:

-   **Tools like `cmd.exe` and `PsExec`**:
    -   These tools act as an intermediary shell and expect arguments to be passed as a full command. They handle the splitting themselves (similar to how you’d run a command in a `cmd.exe` window).
    -   **Example**: Running PowerShell as SYSTEM via `PsExec`, where the entire command (`pwsh.exe -File script.ps1`) is treated as a single unit.

#### Example:

powershell

Copy code

``$commandToRun = "`"$pwshPath`" -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$ScriptPathAsSYSTEM`""

$argList = @(
    "-accepteula",
    "-i",
    "-s",
    "-d",
    $commandToRun  # Full command string passed as a single unit
)

Start-Process -FilePath "PsExec64.exe" -ArgumentList $argList -Wait`` 

**Why**: `PsExec` expects the full PowerShell invocation to be passed as a single string (`$commandToRun`), not as separate elements. If you split the command, `PsExec` might misinterpret the arguments or fail to run them correctly.

### **When NOT to Split into an Array**:

-   **For tools that don't handle array-based arguments properly**, such as `cmd.exe` or `PsExec`, splitting arguments can cause failures because they expect arguments to be handled as a single unit.
-   If you notice the tool you're working with expects arguments passed as a single string in other command-line shells (`cmd`, batch scripts), it's likely better to use a single string in PowerShell as well.

### **Rule of Thumb**:

-   **Use arrays** for modern tools and PowerShell cmdlets where arguments need to be distinct and handled separately.
-   **Use a single string** for tools that behave like shells (`cmd.exe`, `PsExec`, `bash`, etc.), especially when passing complex commands or multiple arguments at once.

I hope this clarifies when to split arguments into an array versus passing them as a single string! Let me know if you need further clarification.
